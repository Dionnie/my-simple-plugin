## üöÄ Quick Start Guide for My Simple Plugin

Follow these steps to get started with **My Simple Plugin**:

### 1. Add Your Favorite jQuery Plugin

Download your desired jQuery plugin and place its CSS and JS files inside the plugin‚Äôs `assets/` directory.

### 2. Enqueue Scripts and Styles

Open the file:
`includes/class-my-simple-plugin-public.php`
Inside the `enqueue_scripts()` method, enqueue the plugin‚Äôs assets using `wp_enqueue_script()` and `wp_enqueue_style()`.

### 3. Load Custom CSS/JS

Ensure the following options are loaded **after** your jQuery plugin:

* `get_option('custom-css')` for custom CSS
* `get_option('custom-js')` for custom JavaScript

> ‚úÖ Refer to how it's implemented in the default TwentyTwenty plugin as a reference for load order.

### 4. Customize via Dashboard

Go to your WordPress dashboard:
**Dashboard > My Simple Plugin**
Start building or editing your custom CSS and JS directly from the plugin interface.
